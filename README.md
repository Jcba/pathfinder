# Pathfinder 

Pathfinder finds the shortest route between two points. It reads OSM data and transforms this to a routable graph. 
The project aims to be simple and extendable.

## Usage

You will need an OSM region extract in pbf format. 

## Why 

Just because I can. It's written for fun and to find out how hard it would be to write something like this from scratch.
